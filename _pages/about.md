About Me
======

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), where I have the privilege of being supervised by [Prof.Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io). Before joining HKU, I obtained my Master's degree from Yale University, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof.Leying Guan](https://campuspress.yale.edu/lguan) and collaborating closely with [Prof.Sten H. Vermund](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/sten-vermund/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree from Renmin University of China (RUC). Here is my [CV](https://github.com/yujinhan98/yujinhan98.github.io/blob/master/yujin_CV_2023.pdf).

I maintain a curiosity for any challenging research topics in machine learning and deep learning, exploring them with the aim of creating technology that can benefit the public. Recently, I have been focusing on robust and reliable machine learning issues from the perspective of foundation models.


News
======
- [2024-01] Our work, CSForest, which aims to perform efficient conformal prediction and anomaly detection under general label shift, was accepted by AISTATS 2024.
- [2023-10] Our work, DISK, which is a novel idea for inferring the domain label under the subpopulation shift setting, was accepted by the [Causal Representation Learning workshop in NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/66497). The paper (under review) and code will be released soon.
- [2023-09] I commenced my doctoral journey at HKU under the guidance of Prof.Difan Zou.
