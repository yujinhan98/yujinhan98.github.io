I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), fortunate to be under the guidance of [Prof.Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree at Yale University, where I collaborated closely with [Prof.Leying Guan](https://campuspress.yale.edu/lguan) and [Prof.Sten H. Vermund](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/sten-vermund/), and I also hold a Bachelor's degree from Renmin University of China (RUC). Here is my [CV](https://github.com/yujinhan98/yujinhan98.github.io/blob/master/yujin_CV_2023.pdf).

I maintain a curiosity for any challenging research topics in machine learning and statistical learning, exploring them with the aim of creating technology that can benefit the general public. My research goal is to propose simple and novel methods with elegant theoretical support to uncover the essence of problems and offer new perspectives for the ML community. Recently, I focus on subpopulation shift problems in domain generalization.
