I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree in Science at Yale University, where I collaborated closely with [Prof. Leying Guan](https://campuspress.yale.edu/lguan), and I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China.

I am open to any challenging research topics in machine learning and statistical learning. My research goal is to use simple and innovative methods with theoretical support to reveal the essence of problems and provide new perspectives for the community. Recently, I have been focusing on subpopulation shift problems in domain generalization.
